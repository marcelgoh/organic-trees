\maketitle{Weyl trees of famous irrational numbers}{by}{Marcel K. Goh}{3 May 2020}

These trees were created by inserting the sequence $\{\theta\}, \{2\theta\}, \{3\theta\},\ldots$ into a binary search tree, where $\theta$ is an irrational number and $\{x\}$ denotes the fractional part of $x$. For example, $\{\pi\} = \{0.14159\ldots\}$. External nodes are drawn as small isoceles triangles and internal nodes are drawn as rectangles. The size and angle of a given rectangle are proportional to the Horton-Strahler number of the corresponding node.

If $\theta$ is irrational, the sequence $(n\theta)$ is not periodic. However, due to PostScript's floating-point representation of real numbers, this is not true in our program. We have kept the number of nodes small enough so that this does not affect the drawings.
